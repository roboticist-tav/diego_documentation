I am a roboticist, currently working on an instruction language (computer language) for squads of robots.  I have two distinct groups of squad of robots to instruct: one is termed 'swarm' which has become the de facto terminology used in this industry (definition provided below) and another which has a different scope in its definition.

This is what I would consider the most apt definition for a 'swarm' of robots:
> In most swarm algorithms, individuals perform according to local rules and the overall behaviour emerges organically from the interplay of the individuals of the swarm.

\-  Schranz, Melanie *et al* (2020); 'Swarm Robotic Behaviors and Current Applications'; Frontiers in Robotics and AI, Vol. 7, 2020

The other group of squads of robots I will be working on would be an edited definition as:

> ...individuals perform according to ~~local~~ **global shared** rules and the overall behaviour emerges ~~organically~~ **democratically** from the ~~interplay~~ **intercourse** of the individuals of the swarm.
