# Corpus
The corpus of **Diego** use is show here as aspects of other systems that encroach on aspects provided by **Diego**.  This could include translations of concepts, or approaches made to achieve the same (or similar) outcomes.

Other additions to the corpus include attempt to resolve set tasks provided in all three domains covered by **Diego** (abstract, metaphysical, and, physical).

## Rosetta Code
Rosetta Code is a wiki-based programming website with implementations of common algorithms and solutions to various programming problems in many different programming languages. **Diego** contributions have been made to the site demostrating the programming style in the abstract domain.

See: [Diego on Rosetta Code](https://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/diego)


## MAVLink
**MAVLink**, or Micro Air Vehicle Link, is a protocol for communicating with aerial mobile systems. It was first released in early 2009 by Lorenz Meier under the LGPL license. This is similar to the metaphysical and physical *programming* of arieal robots ***Diego*** provides. MAVLink does not provide the same 'programability' as ***Diego***, since MAVLink follows the classic human-centric approach. Although, messaging through MAVLink is exceptionally lighter than ***Diego***.

## The Caterpillar Chain
The Caterpillar Chain is a baton movement of two or more agents who form a chain by association and follow, in common, a rectilinear locomotion.

See: [Caterpillar Chain](tasks/caterpillar.md)

## Packing Up
This task requires the use of abstract collection objects.
