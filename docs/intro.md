# Diego Introduction
The Diego instruction programming language is an open source project to make roboticists more productive.

## What is Diego?
Diego is structured, expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write and execute instructions that get the most out of robots and smart devices (things), while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Diego is direct, real-time, and, intelligent language for robots and things to communicate and learn.

## What can Diego do?

* Communicate intelligent and life-learning strategies between robot ↔ robot, and, robot ↔ human
* Provide a universal communication protocol for thingies (robots and things)
* Empower quick and precise swarming strategies
* Remove telemetry clutter by allowing robots and things to think for themselves
* Remove the reliance of human-computer micro-management by giving robots and things more responsibilities

## Why Diego?
* Diego has a structured syntax with mostly English language words.

## Good to know

## Hello World

The atypical 'hello world' example can easily be performed on a `console` as:

```diego
with_me()_msg(Hello, World!);
```
The [syntax](./syntax.md) is very structured, but flexible to compose.
