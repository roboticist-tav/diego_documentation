# Diego Introduction

## What is Diego?
Diego is a popular instruction language. It was created by Tavis Pitt, and released in 2020. The Diego instruction programming language is an open source project to make roboticists more productive.

Diego is structured, expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write and execute instructions that get the most out of robots and smart devices (things), while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Diego is direct, real-time, and, intelligent language for robots and things to communicate and learn.
