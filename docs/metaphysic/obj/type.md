# Type (object)
The `type` object is a metaphysical object to store and use a _typeof_ construction off another physic-only *object*. If the thingy allows, types can be overloaded either within or out of an environment or namespace.

## Syntax
The default declartion must invole at least the moniker of the type and a physic object to append the type to. 

Following the _with-this-do-that_ syntactial approach, the syntax, is straight foward. With the _with-that-do-this_ approach the `_totype` posit must be used:

`add_type(`*`moniker`*`)_object(`*`objectname`*`)`
`add_object(`*`moniker`*`)_totype(`*`objectname`*`)`


Note, `type` is restricted to only being applied to physic objects.  The callee (usually yourself) will return something like: `with_type(`*`moniker`*`)_object(`*`objectname`*`)_err(d45f, type only on physic object)`
