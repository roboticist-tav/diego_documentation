# Diego API Documentation
The Diego instruction programming language is an open source project to make roboticists more productive.

Diego is structured, expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency mechanisms make it easy to write and execute instructions that get the most out of robots and smart devices (things), while its novel type system enables flexible and modular program construction. Diego is direct, real-time, and, intelligent language for robots and things to communicate and learn.

Diego provides advantages for both robotics and IoT, for instance:

* Communicate intelligent and life-learning strategies between robot ↔ robot, and, robot ↔ human
* Provide a universal communication protocol for thingies (robots and things)
* Empower quick and precise swarming strategies
* Remove telemetry clutter by allowing robots and things to think for themselves
* Remove the reliance of human-computer micro-management by giving robots and things more responsibilities
